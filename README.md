# capysocket
My own rust implementation of the websocket protocol as defined in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-5.5.3
It probably doesn't match the spec completely, but it can connect to browsers and send and read messages.

I made this to understand the protocol better, it will probably also be used in Watchwithfriends (my another project).
